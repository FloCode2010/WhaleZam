1. This App uses numpy, scipy, tkinter and wave (which is included in scipy).
If you don't have these libraries, you can install them with the command `pip install numpy scipy tkinter` in your terminal (pip is required for this command).
2. To run this app, you can either use the command `python main.py` (python is required for this command) in the direcctory the `main.py` file is in or you can run it using a code editor like Visual Studio Code (download at     https://code.visualstudio.com/) or by using python to open it.
3. The Databank can't be extended easily until now, but we will release a databank upgrade in the near future (march-april 2025).
